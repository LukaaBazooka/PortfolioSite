### **About Me**
At the time of writing this, i am 17 years old and studying at [Lewes College](https://www.escg.ac.uk/explore/lewes/). 
All my work here is from the years studyng here and the years prior learning the basics, such as GSCE elements, or my self taught skills.
Prior to starting at lewes college i taught myself the basic in python and also got slightly more adept in LUA, mainly for a small game development hobby within the game [ROBLOX](https://www.roblox.com/discover#/). 
I also learnt blender basics, which helped me develop my skills in model creation. During college this aided me a lor as i learnt even more from blender, having not needed to realearn the basics.
Im happy to say im skilled in making models in and out of blender.

_Another thing id like to note is i learnt the basics of animations such as the knowledge of easing types._
